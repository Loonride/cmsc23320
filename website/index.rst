CMSC 23320 - Foundations of Computer Networks
=============================================

.. admonition:: What happened to CMSC 23300 Networks and Distributed Systems?

   This class was offered for many years under a different code and name, *CMSC 23300 Networks and Distributed Systems*, despite
   the fact that it only covered Networks topics (with Distributed Systems topics covered in *CMSC 23310 Advanced Distributed
   Systems*). So, in 2020, we renamed CMSC 23300 to better reflect its contents and scope. However, other than the change in
   code and name, CMSC 23320 covers the same topics and uses the same projects as CMSC 23300.
