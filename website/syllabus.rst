Course organization
-------------------

The development of three programming projects accounts for the majority
of the grade in this course. To successfully complete these projects,
students must master fundamental concepts and skills in networking. The
class meets two times a week for lectures that provide a conceptual
scaffolding for the projects, but will also cover material that is not
directly applied in the projects. There is also an optional weekly
discussion session primarily intended for in-depth discussion of the
projects. Besides the projects, students will also be evaluated with a
midterm and a final exam. The course calendar, including the contents of
each lecture and project deadlines, is shown in the `Course Calendar <calendar.html>`_ page.

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Throughout the quarter, students will develop three projects:

#. **chirc**: Implementing an Internet Relay Protocol (IRC)
   server (partially compliant with RFC 2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813)
   using POSIX sockets and pthreads.

#. **chiTCP**: Implementing the Transmission Control Protocol.

#. **chirouter**: Implementing an Internet router using the `Mininet network emulator <https://github.com/mininet/mininet>`_

Each project is independent from the others. Students will develop these 
projects in pairs; project groups must be formed by Monday of the
second week of the quarter.
Groups can be changed from one project to another. If your partner drops out of
the course or you feel they are not contributing to the group’s effort,
you should make the instructor aware of this.

Discussion Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The course includes an optional discussion session which will focus
primarily on the projects. During these discussion sessions, we will (1)
provide suggestions on how to approach the projects, (2) provide general
feedback on submitted projects, and (3) provide a general forum to
answer questions about the projects. For avoidance of doubt, the
discussion sessions are not intended to provide individual feedback or
help on the projects; please use Piazza and office hours for that
purpose.

Even though these discussion sessions are optional and have no direct
impact on your grade, we encourage you to attend them, as they will
provide you with very valuable pointers on how to do the projects. At
the very least, one of the two members in each group should plan to
attend the discussion session each week.

Please note thar the first discussion session will provide a refresher on socket 
programming (which may or may not have been covered in CMSC 15400 depending
on when you took it). If you did not cover sockets in CMSC 15400 (or it
has been a while since you took CMSC 15400), we *strongly* encourage
you to attend this discussion session.

Exams
~~~~~

There will be an in-class midterm half-way through the quarter,
and a final exam will take place during Finals Week. Please
see the `Course Calendar <calendar.html>`_ page for the exact dates.

Questions and exercises related to the projects will make up a
substantial part of both exams. Students who have worked on the projects
(which requires understanding the material presented in class) should be
able to answer these questions with relative ease. However, the exams
will also include questions that are not related to the projects, but
will be in line with the learning goals outlined at the beginning of
this syllabus.

Books
-----

This course has two *suggested* texts:

-  *Computer Networks: A Systems Approach*, 5th edition, Larry L.
   Peterson and Bruce S. Davie, Morgan Kaufmann 2012.

-  *TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols*, 2nd Edition, Kevin
   Fall and W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley 2011.

Both are available for purchase from the Seminary Co-op Bookstore. These
texts are *not* required, and most students are able to complete the
class successfully without them. However, they can be a good complement
to the lectures and projects.

Grading
-------

The final grade will be based on the following:

- Project 1: 20%
- Project 2: 25%
- Project 3: 15%
- Midterm: 15%
- Final: 25%

Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional
sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:

-  95-100: A
-  90-95: A-
-  85-90: B+
-  80-85: B
-  75-80: B-
-  70-75: C+
-  < 70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis

We curve only to the extent that we may (and often do) *lower* the
boundaries for one or more letter grades, depending on the distribution
of the raw scores. We will never raise the boundaries in response to the
distribution.

Before the end of the quarter, we will provide students with an
estimated grade based on all the work they have done up to that point.
We may also provide a preliminary and non-binding list of grade boundaries.

Types of grades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students may take this course for a quality grade (a "letter" grade) or
a pass/fail grade. By default, we assume students are taking the class
for a quality grade. We will honor all requests to take the
class pass/fail *before* the final exam. Requests for withdrawal must
be submitted to your College advisor.

Note: *Students taking this course to meet general education
requirements must take the course for a letter grade*.

Late submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you work on the projects with the same partner throughout the quarter,
then the late submission policy is simple: you have four 24-hour extensions 
to use at your discretion on any of the projects. Take into account that:

- Extensions are all-or-nothing: if you use an extension, you get an indivisible
  24-hour extension. You cannot use a portion of an extension 
  and have the rest “carry over” to another extension.
- More than one extension can be applied to a single submission. 
  e.g., a single 24-hour extension on four submissions, or a 96-hour 
  extension on a single submission.
- You do not need to ask permission to use an extension. Extensions are
  handled automatically by the project submission system we use.
- Extensions cannot be transferred, sold, or exchanged for points.

If extraordinary circumstances (illness, family emergency, etc.) prevent
a student from meeting a deadline, the student must inform the
instructor *before* the deadline. Requests for extraordinary extensions
after a project deadline will not be considered.

If you work with different partners throughout the quarter, the late submission
policy is slightly more complicated. Each individual student has four extensions,
and using an extension as a pair consumes one extension from each student (so,
if you have the same partner throughout the quarter then you have, as a pair, four extensions
as well). However, if you use one extension with one partner, and then form a different group
with someone who has used two extensions already, then you will only be able to
use two extensions as a pair.

Regrades
~~~~~~~~

We sometimes make mistakes, and are happy to review any grading decision that you
feel is unfair or unjustified. However, it is also your responsibility to make
these requests in a timely manner. Requests for regrades must be submitted
no later than **one week** after a graded piece of work is returned to you.
After that time, we will not consider any requests for regrades,
*regardless of whether the regrade request is reasonable and justified*.


Policy on academic honesty
--------------------------

We take academic honesty **very** seriously in this class. Please make sure to 
read our `Academic Honesty <academic_honesty.html>`__ page.


Asking questions
----------------

The preferred form of support for this course is through *Piazza*
(http://www.piazza.com/), an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be enrolled in Piazza at the start of the quarter.

All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Piazza, and not directly to the instructors or TAs, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor or the TAs, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Piazza.

Please see our `Asking Questions <questions.html>`_ page for specific
guidelines and policies related to asking questions on Piazza.

Please note that all course announcements will be made through Piazza. It
is your responsibility to check Piazza often to see if there are any
announcements. Please note that you can configure your Piazza account to
send you e-mail notifications every time there is a new post on Piazza.
Just go to your Account Settings, then to Class Settings, click on "Edit
Notifications" under CMSC 23320. We encourage you to select either the
"Real Time" option (get a notification as soon as there are new posts)
or the "Smart Digest" option (get a summary of all the posts sent over
the last 1-6 hours – you can select the frequency).

Diversity statement
-------------------

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that
arises from multiple perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also 
believe that we have the highest quality interactions and can creatively solve 
more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus expect to 
maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication,
mutual respect, and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students 
bring to this class as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent 
to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, 
sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious 
background, and immigration status. Any suggestions as to how to further 
such a positive and open environment in the class will be appreciated and 
given serious consideration.

If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, 
or preferred gender pronouns you would like us to use, please let us know.

Disability statement
--------------------

If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, please let us
know. We will maintain the confidentiality of any such discussions. If you need accommodations due to
a disability you will also need to contact Student Disability Services at 773-702-6000,
or disabilities@uchicago.edu
