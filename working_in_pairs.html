<h1>Working in Pairs<a class="headerlink" href="#working-in-pairs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this class, you will be developing the course projects in pairs. This is not a gratuitous
decision: in practically all contexts, software development is a team sport, and you will
develop many useful skills by doing these projects in pairs rather than by working on them
individually.</p>
<p>However, working with others can be as challenging as it is rewarding. In this page,
we provide a number of suggestions and tips that can help you make the most out of
working on a software project with others, particularly in the context of a university
course.</p>
<div class="section" id="choosing-a-project-partner">
<h2>Choosing a project partner<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-project-partner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is find a project partner. Choosing your project
partner is not something to take lightly, nor should you just pair up with the
first person who happens to be available. You and your project partner will
be depending on each other throughout the quarter, and you want to make sure
you work well together as a team before you commit to spending ten weeks
together working on the course projects.</p>
<p>Ideally, there is someone in the class that you’ve worked with before (this
doesn’t have to be on a course project; maybe you’ve worked together in
a student organization, in an on-campus job, etc.). If you know that the two
of you already work well together and, more importantly, feel like you
can rely on each other, then you’ll likely work well together in
this class, although you may nonetheless want to have a discussion on
some of the issues we discuss below.</p>
<p>What if you don’t know anyone in the class? This is perfectly normal! (and
there will be a lot of other students in that same situation) However, you
may want to consider the following before pairing up with someone:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Preferred means of communication</em>: As we’ll discuss below, communication
is a key aspect of succeeding as a team. The two of you will need to be
able to easily reach each other (sometimes frequently and on short notice);
make sure the two of you have at least one messaging platform (Messenger, Slack,
texting, etc.) that you already use and where you can be easily reached.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Work schedules</em>: Make sure you have compatible work schedules. If you’re
a night owl, and your project partner is a morning person, or if you
expect to do most of your work on weekends but your partner doesn’t, then
you may find it difficult to meet and to communicate throughout the quarter.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Level of experience</em>: You will usually want to pair up with someone that is
at roughly your same level. If you’re a fourth year who is almost done with the CS major,
and you pair up with a second year who is fresh out of the intro sequence,
you may get frustrated by the fact that your partner progresses more slowly
through the projects.</p>
<p>There is one notable exception to this: pairing up with someone less experienced
than you for the express purpose of having a mentorship relationship can be
a very fulfilling experience for the both of you. However, you need to make sure you’re both on
board with this, and understand that the less experienced partner may need
some hand-holding throughout the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communication">
<h2>Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Good communication is essential to working productively in a team. We suggest
that, at the very least, you meet in person at the start of each project
to decide on a plan for completing the project (we provide
some pointers on this below), and then plan to check in with each other
at least every 1-2 days. Take into account that
this doesn’t have to be an in-person meeting: you could simply chat online or
have a quick call. These check-ins can also be pretty informal: in fact,
instead of setting a specific time to meet every 1-2 days, you may simply
settle into a routine of regularly chatting online about the project.</p>
<p>Regardless of how or when you check in with each other, here are a few things you may want to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>What are you each working on?</em> Provide a quick overview of what you’re working
on at the moment, and what you expect to work on in the next few days. It can
be specially useful to discuss what (if anything) has changed since your last check-in,
and what you expect to get done by the next check-in.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Are we on track?</em> We encourage you not to frame your check-in in terms of
“what work have you done?” and, instead, in terms of holistically assessing whether you
are on track to complete the project.</p>
<p>Most notably, it can be perfectly normal to not get any work done from one check-in to another!
This may be something you already expected (e.g., at your previous check-in,
you may have told your partner that you had a midterm coming up in another class,
and that you had to focus on that), or something unexpected (your dog got sick
and you had to spend all day at the vet). In any case, a frequent check-in can
allow you to frequently reassess whether you are still on track, and whether
you need to make any adjustments to your plan.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Do you need help with anything?</em> Even if you’ve taken responsibility for one
part of the project, that doesn’t mean that your partner can’t help you with it.
If you’re stuck on something, this is a good moment to bring it up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, you will make a somewhat firm commitment to get something done by an
agreed upon deadline, specially as the actual deadline for a project gets closer.
Some of those times, you may not be able to get that work done (for any number of
reasons) and it is important that you communicate this to your project partner as
soon as possible (ideally as soon as it becomes clear you won’t be able to meet
the deadline you agreed on, instead of waiting for that deadline to pass).
While it can be tough to admit you may not be able to do something you committed
to doing, having an early and frank discussion about it gives the two of you an
opportunity to regroup and figure out how to stay on track.</p>
<p>Take into account that correctly estimating the time and
effort required for a task is challenging even for seasoned software developers,
and it happens more frequently than you’d imagine in many software projects.
If it happens to you, don’t think of it as having done something wrong:
you’re simply getting the hang of figuring out how long it takes to do something,
particularly in a collaborative setting. This is another reason why frequent
check-ins are important: they can help you catch these issues sooner rather than later.
It is better to identify this issue (and reassess the way forward with
your project partner) once you realize it’s going to take you longer than expected,
instead of plowing through and then revealing to your partner that you
didn’t get to other tasks because you spent so much extra time on another
task.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-project-management-basics">
<h2>Some project management basics<a class="headerlink" href="#some-project-management-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For many of you, this will be your first time working on a complex programming project with another person.
This is very different from working individually on a programming assignment, and will
require spending some time on project management activities. While these may instinctively feel
like a waste of time (because it’s time you’re not spending coding and making tangible progress
on the project), they can pay off handsomely in the long run. While we can’t teach you
all about project management in this class, we provide below a few essential tips that
you may find useful.</p>
<div class="section" id="start-early">
<h3>Start early<a class="headerlink" href="#start-early" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We’re sure you’re told in all your classes that you shouldn’t wait until right
before the deadline to start working on an assignment. We realize this is not always
possible (given all the demands on your time) but we encourage you,
if possible, to get an early start in the first projects.
This is when you will start working with your project partner,
and will likely have to iron out the ways in which you collaborate best, and this
will take time. You want to allow plenty of time before the deadline to figure
our how to work effectively together, and you will find this much easier to do
outside of the context of a pre-deadline time crunch.</p>
<p>Once you’ve settled into a good working relationship, it may be a bit easier
to live on the razor’s edge but, even so,
we will reiterate that the best way to have a productive and fun experience
with these projects is to start early and to spread the work before the deadline,
instead of planning on a pre-deadline coding marathon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h3>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Software Design involves specifying the structure of the software to be implemented, the data models
and structures used by the system, the interfaces between system components and, sometimes, the
algorithms used. In many software projects, this involves writing a <em>design document</em> containing
this information.</p>
<p>Before you write a single line of code, we strongly encourage you to sit together and draft
a design document for the project you are about to start working on. This doesn’t have to
be a formal document (nor is it something we require you to hand in along with your code),
but it can help you think through how you will structure your code which, in turn, will
make it easier for you to divide the work in concrete ways.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things you may want to specify in your design document:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What structs will you be defining?</li>
<li>Will you need any additional data structures? (lists, hash tables, etc.)</li>
<li>What functions will you be defining? What will their parameters and return values be?</li>
<li>[Mostly Project 1 only] What C modules will you define? (i.e., what C files will you add
to the projects, and what functions will go in each of them?) What are the dependencies
between each module? (i.e., what functions from one module are needed in another?)</li>
<li>If there are any complex operations you need to perform in your code, sketch out
the algorithm for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spending time on this may feel like you’re not making tangible progress. Why write something
in a document when you could just start coding? In a short programming assignment, you
<em>can</em> often get away with coding right away, and making
adjustments to your code when you hit a dead end, realize you chose the wrong data
structure, etc. However, that approach doesn’t really scale to a large multi-week project,
where making even small changes to your design could have ripple effects throughout your
entire code.</p>
<p>Not just that, the design document can be an invaluable piece of documentation: in a large
project, you won’t always be 100% familiar with every single piece of code, and it can be
helpful to have a document you can refer to when you need to find out what a given
struct does, or why you decided to define some function in a particular way, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-dividing-the-work">
<h3>(Not) Dividing the work<a class="headerlink" href="#not-dividing-the-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this class, all the projects (except Project 1a) would be very challenging to complete
individually. To complete the work in the project, you will need to divide up the work
and make some progress in parallel.</p>
<p>So, you may be tempted to just look at all the work you have to do and say
“you do this half, I do this other half, let’s put everything together before
we submit”. This is a generally unproductive strategy, and one that will
invariably lead to “integration hell” (when you try to integrate together
the work you each did). It also means that each of you will only be familiar
with half the project (and remember that, on the exams, we will be asking
you about all aspects of the project).</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could do all your work sitting together on the
same computer, but this can be logistically
complicated: you need to find time to physically meet together, and you
lose the ability to parallelize your progress (since you’re limited
to making progress only when the two of you are physically sitting together
at the same computer).</p>
<p>What you need to do is find a balance between these two extremes: when you
identify parts of the project that you can each work on individually,
you can each work on them on your own, but it is important that you communicate
your progress to each other (as noted earlier, communication is key, and this is why
having a regular check-in can be invaluable). Below we discuss one mechanism,
<em>issue tracking</em>, that you may find useful to keep track of your progress
(and to have a more structured communication around specific goals in the project)</p>
<p>Since it is important that you each have total awareness of what is done
in the project, you should get into the habit of reviewing each other’s
code. Not only can this be helpful to understand parts of the project
you’re not directly working on, it can also help catch bugs early. Below
we discuss <em>code reviews</em> in more detail.</p>
<p>Finally, when you’re faced with a particularly challenging part of the project,
it can really pay off to work on that part together, on the same computer, by doing
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">Pair Programming</a>. Some times,
you can already anticipate that some parts will be tricky and can benefit from
Pair Programming; however, if you’re working on a part of the project individually,
and realize you’re getting stuck, you should ask your project partner whether
you can do an improptu Pair Programming session to see if you can get un-stuck.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-git-effectively">
<h3>Using Git effectively<a class="headerlink" href="#using-git-effectively" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this class, you will be doing your work on a Git repository. However, you should
not treat it as a glorified homework submission system, where you just push your
code right before submitting. Instead, it can be an invaluable tool for developing
code collaboratively. Make sure you review our <a class="reference external" href="git.html">Using Git</a> page and,
in particular, that you familiarize yourself with using branches in Git, as
these will be necessary for doing issue tracking and code reviews.</p>
<p>We do have one caveat about branches: avoid having per-person branches (i.e., you
do all your work on all the projects in one branch, and your project partner
does all their work on all the projects in another branch). Below we
suggest a better way to manage branches, where each branch corresponds to a
specific task or issue you’re working on (and, while these will often be worked
upon by just one person, that isn’t always the case).</p>
<p>You should also make sure to set up <a class="reference external" href="ci.html">Continuous Integration</a> (CI) on your
repository. In combination with frequent code reviews, CI is a great tool
for ensuring that you don’t run into last-minute integration issues right before
submitting your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issue-tracking">
<h3>Issue tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s say you’ve divided up the work in one of the projects. For example, one of
you may have claimed responsibility for implementing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MOTD</span></code> command in
Project 1b. Even if you understand that it is important to communicate your
progress, it can be helpful to use a concrete mechanism to track and document
that progress. A common way of doing this is by using an
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system">issue tracking system</a>,
where you create a new “issue” for each concrete task that needs to be completed.
The issue tracker then allows you to add comments to that issue, and
have a single location to discuss anything surrounding that task.</p>
<p>The Git server we use, GitLab, helpfully provides a built-in issue tracker in
each repository (you can see their full documentation <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/issues/">here</a>).
You do, however, need to enable this functionality. In your project,
click on “Settings” -&gt; “General” (in the left sidebar) and then switch “Issues”
to “Only team members”. Don’t forget to then click on “Save Changes”.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say we wanted to create an issue to track the implementation of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MOTD</span></code> command. You would do something like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a new issue titled “Implement MOTD command”: click on “Issues” in the
left sidebar, and then on “New issue”. While it is tempting to leave the
Description blank, it can be helpful to describe in a few sentences what
you will do in this task, including a high-level description of the changes
you expect to make to the code. Make sure you add yourself as the “Assignee”
of that issue. You can also create “Milestones” to easily categorize issues
by project (e.g., “Project 1a”, “Project 1b”, etc.)</li>
<li>Create a new branch in your Git repository to do the work for this task.
You may end up with many such branches (for each issue), so you may want
to decide on a reasonable naming scheme (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p1b-implement-motd</span></code>)</li>
<li>Notice how the issue allows you to add comments. You should use these
to log your progress in this task. For example, let’s say you push a commit
that passes some, but not all, of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MOTD</span></code> tests. You should add a comment
that specifies what progress you’ve made, what tests are passing, and
what remains to be done for the remaining tests to pass.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can reference issues from a commit message, simply by using
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span></code> symbol (e.g., to reference Issue 42 in a commit message, just include
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#42</span></code> somewhere in your commit message). This will make
the commit show up automatically in the issue, which is very helpful to
easily access the exact code associated with a task.</li>
<li>Once a task is completed, close the issue. While you can then merge the
code into your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch, we suggest you do a code review
before doing so.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-reviews">
<h3>Code reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#code-reviews" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s say you just finished implementing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MOTD</span></code> command, and have, by way
of doing so, become an expert on that command. Your partner, unfortunately,
will know nothing about it, except at a very high level. One way to ensure
that you are both familiar with the entire implementation of the project is
to systematically review each others code. More importantly, doing this
can help you catch bugs that you may have missed and will also help you get
comfortable with giving and receiving feedback.</p>
<p>A common mechanism to handle this process is to take the code you produced
as part of an issue and create a <em>pull request</em> or <em>merge request</em> (GitHub uses
the former term, while GitLab uses the latter). A merge request is a request
to merge a branch into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch, typically requiring a
code review from another person (in this case, your project partner) before
the code can be merged to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>. Ideally, this will ensure that
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch stays relatively “clean”, in the sense of never containing
any work in progress or any broken code.</p>
<p>Like issue tracking, you will need to enable this functionality in GitLab. In your project,
click on “Settings” -&gt; “General” (in the left sidebar) and then switch “Merge requests”
to “Only team members”. Don’t forget to then click on “Save Changes”.</p>
<p>Once a branch is ready for review by your project partner, you can create a merge
request by doing the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Click on “Merge Requests” on the left sidebar, and then on “New merge request”
Note: If you recently push a branch, GitLab will helpfully suggest that
specific branch, and you can just click the “Create merge request” button
for that branch instead.</li>
<li>If you clicked “New merge request”, you will need to choose the source
branch (the branch you created for a specific task) and your target branch
(typically the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch).</li>
<li>Once you do this (or if you clicked “Create merge request”) you will be shown
a form similar to the one when you created an issue: you need to provide a
title and description, but you should assign the merge request to your
partner, not to yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>When reviewing a merge request, here are some things to look out for:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Read through the code, and make sure you understand what it does. If anything
is unclear, add a comment in the merge request.</li>
<li>Is the code adequately documented, and does it follow the style guide? If not,
add a comment with a list of the things that should be changed.</li>
<li>Does the code pass all the tests it’s supposed to? While you can check this
manually, you may want to simply set up <a class="reference external" href="ci.html">Continuous Integration</a>.
This will ensure that you never end up merging broken code into your
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t shy away from asking for changes in the code you’re asked to review! As
a reviewer, you’re not supposed to just rubberstamp your partner’s code. If you
see something that should be changed, point it out in a positive and constructive
way.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the code you’ve been asked to review, click on “Close merge request”.
This will merge your code into the target branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-things-go-wrong">
<h2>When things go wrong<a class="headerlink" href="#when-things-go-wrong" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While the suggestions and tips in this page may help you have a productive
and rewarding collaborative experience in the course projects, you may
still hit some bumps in the road. A common issue is feeling like your
project partner may not be as invested in the project as you are, or
having your project partner miss specific goals you both agreed upon.</p>
<p>While it is easy to think your partner is being lazy or unengaged,
and that you’re the one who’s doing most of the work, we encourage
you to avoid that mindset. More often than not, when two people don’t
work well together, it turns out that no single individual is to blame:
maybe it turned out you each had different working styles and did not
work through how to harmonize them, or you were not checking in with
each other often enough and did not catch potential issues early on
(and those issues instead blew up right before the deadline, which
can generate a sense of resentment as you deal with both finishing
the project and dealing with what you perceive to be a sub-par project partner).</p>
<p>In fact, if this is your first time working in a team, it is perfectly
normal to not get it completely right on your first try! So,
if you feel like your collaboration is not being as productive as it
could be, approach it as an opportunity to learn how you could improve
the way that you work as a team. Here are a few
things you may want to discuss if you feel like your work together
isn’t going as smoothly as you hoped:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In general, keep the discussion positive and start by going over
the aspects that worked well. For example, try to make statements
like “I really enjoyed when we did X” or “It was really helpful
when you did Y”. If you can identify aspects of your partnership
that worked well, you will want to nurture those aspects as you
move forward.</li>
<li>If one of you did not meet a goal you agreed upon, don’t try to
figure out who is to blame. Discuss why that goal wasn’t met:
was the goal too ambitious? was it not clear what exactly you
had to accomplish? did you get stuck at some point and
didn’t ask for help? All of these can help you improve your
goal-setting in future projects.</li>
<li>If you feel like you’re not communicating enough, see if there is
a root cause, instead of just making blanket statements like
“You need to reply to my messages sooner!” For example, did
you both agree to use a given messaging platform
to stay in touch when it turned out that one or both of you
